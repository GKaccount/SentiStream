@divaagarpavalakumar6714,The  love for Dhoni is because he is the first of his kind where cricket was dominated by elites only he became the first slumdog millionaire but also made sure that after him that legacy to be continued.  He always backed players from unprivilaged areas like Raina even when he didn't perform well but also respected the talent of professional players like kohli. Also after him the management was entirely changed and now india is a dominant team which overflows with talents because of Dhoni's initiatives. He made many enemies in upper echelon but due to the unquestionable popularity among his devotees thry all eventually became his friends or atleast act like.

@user-jn7ht1zm4n,"बीती रात इंडियन प्रीमियर लीग के इतिहास की सबसे भावुक तस्वीर सामने आई। जब महान सुनील गावस्कर किसी आम फैन की तरह एक ऑटोग्राफ लेने महेंद्र सिंह धोनी के पीछे भागने लगे। मौका था 16वें सीजन में चेपॉक स्टेडियम पर चेन्नई सुपरकिंग्स के आखिरी मैच का, जो 14 मई यानी रविवार रात कोलकाता नाइटराइर्स के खिलाफ खेला गया। धोनी की टीम भले ही मैच हार गई, लेकिन अपने फैंस का शुक्रिया अदा करने चेन्नई सुपरकिंग्स का पूरा स्क्वॉड एमए चिदंबरम स्टेडियम का चक्कर लगाने लगा, तभी गावस्कर पीछे से आ गए।

अपने सीनियर सुनील गावस्कर को ऑटोग्राफ देना खुद धोनी के लिए भी गर्व का पल रहा होगा। ऐसे में जब लिटिल मास्टर की शर्ट पर धोनी ऑटोग्राफ देने लगे तो समूचा स्टेडियम चीयर करने लगा। कमेंट्री का जिम्मा संभाल रहे गावस्कर जब मैच के बाद शो के लिए पहुंचे तो टीवी पर दुनिया के सामने चंद मिनट पहले हुई इन घटनाओं का जिक्र करना नहीं भूले। पोस्ट मैच शो के दौरान सुनील गावस्कर ने कैमरामैन को अपनी शर्ट जूम करने कहा क्योंकि उन्हें माही का ऑटोग्राफ दिखाना था। गावस्कर ने स्टार स्पोर्ट्स से कहा, 'उन्हें कौन प्यार नहीं करता? उन्होंने इतने सालों में भारतीय क्रिकेट के लिए जो किया है वह अद्भुत है। सबसे महत्वपूर्ण बात यह है कि वह रोल मॉडल रहे हैं। इतने सारे युवा उन्हें देखते हैं। जैसे ही मैंने सुना कि वो पूरी टीम के साथ मैदान के चक्कर लगाने वाले हैं, मैंने किसी से पेन उधार लेकर चुपचाप अपने पास रख ली।'
